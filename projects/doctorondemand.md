Doctor on Demand enables us to speak with experienced and licensed specialist doctors instantly at any time
of day through video conferencing. Me and my teammate developed this app in a 24 hour offline hackathon Hack NSUT and implemented Agora in it. Designed front-end in NextJs,back-end by NodeJs and MongoDB to store users and doctors profile in database.
